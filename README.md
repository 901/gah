Cards Against Humanity, but with GIFs! Built at HackPrinceton Fall 2016.

Equipped with a random cat photo, battle your friends by picking the best out of a hand of random GIFs from Giphy!
Uses Microsoft Computer Vision API to title each GIF - just hover over your hand :^)
Uses NodeJS and Socket.io to manage group membership through multicast event messaging between clients and the server.

To run locally: make sure you have NodeJS installed. Run npm install and then node index.js to run the server on localhost:3000.
